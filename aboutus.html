        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <h3 class="h223">Guild</h3>
        <p>We are a growing guild and Discord community built around PikaNetwork BedWars, bringing together players and
            creators from different games and interests. Our goal is to create a friendly, active, and supportive space
            where everyone feels welcome.<br><br>
            Our Discord server focuses mainly on Minecraft (PikaNetwork BedWars), but we also have active members who
            play Valorant and Roblox. Beyond gaming, our server is a large and diverse community made up of artists,
            readers, students, business-minded individuals, coders, and fans of manhua, manhwa, manga, and anime. <br><br>
<h3 class="h223">Creators</h3>
            We actively support content creators by promoting YouTubers within our community. Verified creators receive
            a YouTube role, allowing them to use the @YouTube ping to share their content with members who opt in for
            notifications. This helps creators grow while keeping promotions organized and respectful. <br><br>
       <h3 class="h223">Discord Partnerships</h3>
            We also engage in Discord partnerships with established servers that have 100+ members, helping expand our
            network and strengthen our community connections. <br><br>

            Whether you are here to play BedWars, connect with like-minded people, share your creativity, or grow as a
            creator, our community is a place to chill, compete, and grow together. <br>
